* Introduction
  Welcome to Emacs java utils. This document should give you a brief introduction
  about how to handle these tools to make java project creation in emacs easier.

** What are those magic utils?
   These utils are an attempt to make it easy to create and maintain Java Projects
   in Emacs.

   Some people think that eclipse is the only ide (editor) to maintain Java project.
   But sorry I pretty hate eclipse and I really don't want to swap my lovely Emacs
   against it only for programming java in university.

   So I'm forced to find another solution. I know there is [[http://jdee.sourceforge.net][JDEE]], but this is not
   an option: I don't like eclipse because I'm a minimalist and don't like fat ide's,
   so I'm not interested in blowing up my emacs to similar level.

   Well, this was the reason, why I wrote my own solution. The tiny java-utils.
   A small collection of tools that help you to make your projects compatible
   with those created by eclipse users.

* Installation
  Simply download the java-utils.el from github and put it somewhere Emacs can find it.

  Then source it in your `.emacs' file.

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  (require 'java-utils)
